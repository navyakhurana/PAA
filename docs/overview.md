# OVERVIEW
## Develop a multitenant Software as a Service application in SAP BTP using CAP 

[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/SAP-samples/btp-kyma-cap-multitenant-susaas)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/SAP-samples/btp-kyma-cap-multitenant-susaas)

## Description

The **Sustainable SaaS (SusaaS)** sample application has been built in a partner collaboration to help interested developers, partners, and customers in developing multitenant Software as a Service applications using CAP and deploying them to the SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP). For this use-case, the **Kyma Runtime** was chosen. Still, you can also develop similar SaaS applications in other runtimes like **Cloud Foundry** or the SAP BTP **ABAP environment**.

The example focuses on using standard frameworks and SAP BTP services for developing, deploying, and monitoring the solution like the Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP), SAP API Management, Alert Notification, and many more. 

The sample application has a focus on the topic of sustainability and is therefore called **Sustainable SaaS** (SuSaaS) app. It allows customers (**Consumer Tenants**) of the SaaS application to extend their SAP solutions like S/4HANA with additional features developed by the SaaS vendor (**Provider**). 

Due to the technical and theoretical complexity of the topic, the sample application shall not be seen or used in any kind for productive scenarios. It is supposed to present ideas and approaches for putting your scenario into practice. Our goal is to cover as many topics as we can, but not in the greatest depth that might justify productive usability.  

Below you can find a solution architecture diagram of the sample application. As you can see, the app contains a lot of services and tools which you will use in this tutorial (click to enlarge).

This includes for example a SAP API Management integration to monitor and manage your SaaS API endpoints or SAP Identity Authentication to provide a central user management without relying on SAP ID service. Furthermore, you will learn and see a sample of how to integrate a backend system like SAP S/4HANA from a SaaS Consumer perspective.

## Requirements

If not yet done, for this sample application we recommend to set up a **Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG)** or **CPEA** account and use the mentioned **Free (Tier) service plans**. A tutorial how to setup a PAYG account (allowing you to use all Free Tier service plans) can be found in the [Tutorial Navigator](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/btp-free-tier-account.html). 


### Basic Version

The **Basic Version** of the sample application requires the following set of SAP BTP entitlements in the Provider Subaccount and can be done using **Free (Tier) service plans** of **PAYG** and **CPEA** accounts.

:::tip **Hint** 
The Basic Version of the SaaS application can also be deployed to Kyma environments in **Trial** accounts, although we recommend to use one of the account types mentioned above. Please make sure to choose the **us10** region to use SAP HANA Cloud in this case.

> **\*** **SAP Integration Suite** - The **free service plan** is usable for 90 days only. Your tenant will be decommissioned after 90 days and you need to set up a new tenant if you wish to do further validations. 

> **\*\*** **SAP Identity Authentication** 
> > When signing up for a PAYG or CPEA account, you're entitled for a free test and productive SAP Identity Authentication Service tenant. Any further tenant can be licensed as **Additional Tenant** and will be charged according to your account type. Please also check the official SAP Help documentation ([click here](https://help.sap.com/docs/IDENTITY_AUTHENTICATION/6d6d63354d1242d185ab4830fc04feb1/93160ebd2dcb40e98aadcbb9a970f2b9.html?locale=en-US#loio93160ebd2dcb40e98aadcbb9a970f2b9__licensing_section)) and the following blog post ([click here](https://blogs.sap.com/2021/10/26/is-sap-cloud-identity-services-for-free/)) for further information. 
> 
> > Using the **Default (Application)** plan of the **Cloud Identity Services** offering, you can create a new SAP Identity Authentication Service if required. Please check for potentially existing tenants first, to make sure you are sticking to the free service offering limits.


> **\*\*\*** **SAP S/4HANA** - An SAP S/4HANA system is required if you want to test the automated data push feature from an existing SAP On-Premise solution. While we recommend to use at least the SAP S/4HANA 2021 release, with a bit of coding effort you should be able to also integrate older releases. This guide assumes you have access to an 2021 release. Feel free to check out the SAP Cloud Appliance Library (https://cal.sap.com/) to get yourself a free test license. 


## Known Issues
**Open**
  - Automated Credential Rotation (Workaround available - 2023/06/09)
    - **Problem**: Users are facing a callback authentication error after successful login via SAP IAS as part of the One-Domain concept. 
    - **Issue**: Activating the automated credential rotation of the SAP BTP Service Operator renews the X.509 certificate of the respective SAP IAS service bindings. As the Application Router caches the binding details for performance reasons, the cached X.509 certificate is not valid anymore after rotation. This results in an authentication error between Application Router and SAP IAS. 
    - **Workaround**: A restart of the Application Router after credential rotation will solve this issue and the latest X.509 certificate is being cached. This restart can be automated in a Kubernetes/Kyma CronJob, starting a new Deployment rollout according to your credential rotation cycle. You can find an example incl. roles and service accounts in the respective Expert Features ([click here]( docs/project-panel/4-expert/onboard-automation-domain/code/deployment-restart.yaml)). Combined with an external Redis cache for Application Router session management, downtimes can be minimized or completely mitigated! Make sure to have a sufficient overlap of both, the old and new X.509 certificate (*rotatedBindingTTL: 24h* & *rotationFrequency: 48h*), so the cached credentials are still valid until the restart has happened!
    - **Solution**: Issue has been addressed and a potential notification mechanism might trigger an automated update of the Application Router cache in the future (subject to change). 
  - Consumer extension API issue (Workaround available - 2022/12/19)
    - **Problem**: Applying a Consumer extension currently results in the Push API not being usable by the extended Tenant anymore. 
    - **Issue**: The current implementation has issues to read and process the CSN file of the extended SaaS CAP service. This service serves as a base for the API CAP service.
    - **Workaround**: Extensibility has been temporarily disabled for the CAP API Service.
    - **Solution**: Issues has been addressed with the CAP product management and potential solutions will be worked on.

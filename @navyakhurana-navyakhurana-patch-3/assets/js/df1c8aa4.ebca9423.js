These ",(0,r.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Infrastructure as a Service")," providers can offer cheap alternatives by hosting thousands of servers in their data centers, and also taking away the pain of handling low-level infrastructure tasks like Network or Storage requirements. While IaaS is a huge business and gives companies across the globe great flexibility in designing their IT landscape, it still requires a comparable high effort for a lot of scenarios that can be standardized. "),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"Let's take extension requirements in a customer's SAP landscape for example. Let's assume you want to extend a standard SAP S/4HANA app, you might probably need some kind of persistency, a service managing your events, a development tool for your team, and all services required by a professional app like Runtime, Logging, Alerts, Security and more. Setting up all these requirements in an IaaS environment for each new extension application would be quite some overhead. For this reason, the idea of ",(0,r.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Platform as a Service (PaaS)")," was born. PaaS offerings often provide very broad features and tools, that allow you to focus on specific tasks, without dealing with the requirement to set up lower or medium-level requirements. This might reach from Storage or Networking requirements, up to managed Databases or Operating systems. With the PaaS provider being responsible for all these components, the developers can fully concentrate on their actual job of developing the extension application instead of caring about the required technology stack (which is almost equal for each app).

Compared to IaaS and PaaS, in this scenario, a customer does not get in touch with the underlying platform or infrastructure anymore. Ideally, a SaaS Consumer doesn't even know or is interested in the details of the technology stack but is just interested in using a highly standardized software product, fulfilling a specific purpose. Compared to IaaS or SaaS, the flexibility in this scenario is very limited, on the other side, the maintenance for a consumer is almost zero, as almost all reliability is with the SaaS provider. Is it updates to the databases, deployment of new releases, scaling of the solutions, fixing bugs, or anything else on the infrastructure and platform level. "),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"SAP S/4HANA Cloud is a perfect example of such a SaaS application in a B2B context. SAP's S/4HANA Cloud customers don't have to deal with hosting, updates, bugfixes, or any cumbersome system management tasks anymore. All of this is taken care of by SAP, which is a huge relief for many customers nowadays. On the other side, the customizing features are extremely limited compared to an SAP S/4HANA On Premise system. The reason for that is very simple. A SaaS offering is only profitable for the SaaS provider if further licenses can be sold with minimal marginal costs per instance. So imagine selling a thousand SAP S/4HANA Cloud instances and allowing all consumers to adapt ABAP code on a low level, a collective update of all instances will be almost impossible. This is why SaaS applications are usually very restricted in customizing features allowing a stable core application that can be easily hosted, updated, and maintained.

Wow, this sounds like a super feasible and cheap option for all SAP customers being required to report to regulatory bodies. For sure, the provider of such a SaaS application will have a considerable effort of maintaining such a SaaS offering and keeping it up to date, but imagine one day 1000 companies subscribe to your app for on average 10 users per month?

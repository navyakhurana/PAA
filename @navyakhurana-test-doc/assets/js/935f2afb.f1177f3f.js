using SAP Identity Authentication Service","description":"In this part of the tutorial, you will learn how you as a SaaS Provider can set up a central user management using SAP Identity Authentication Service (SAP IAS). This makes your solution independent from SAP ID Service, which requires users of your SaaS consumers to sign up for an SAP-managed user account. Using SAP IAS you can manage (register, unregister, reset passwords, ...) all SaaS Consumer users in a central place.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"project-panel/advanced/integrate-sap-api-management/README":{"id":"project-panel/advanced/integrate-sap-api-management/README","title":"Integrate SAP API Management","description":"As your SaaS application contains an API that allows your Subscriber to interact programmatically with their Tenant database containers, you need to ensure that your API endpoints are properly managed and monitored. For this purpose, you should implement features like Rate Limiting to prevent DoS attacks. Furthermore, you can ensure fair usage of the resources among your consumers by setting up a Quota based on the chosen service plan. A premium Subscriber can be eligible to send more requests per second than a standard Consumer. Proper monitoring of your API will help you analyze performance issues and to identify problems of your consumers.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"project-panel/advanced/introduction-advanced-version/README":{"id":"project-panel/advanced/introduction-advanced-version/README","title":"Advanced Version Introduction","description":"The Basic and Advanced Version of the sample application require the same setup, which means you have to get started with the Basic Version, before challenging yourself with the Advanced Version.

This will allow your consumers to make use of their own data within your SaaS service offering and gain real business value out of it. For sure a SaaS solution can always offer an Excel upload or an online interface for maintaining tenant-specific data, but an automated backend integration is more than just a nice to have especially when dealing with constantly changing data sets.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"project-panel/advanced/understand-repo-details/README":{"id":"project-panel/advanced/understand-repo-details/README","title":"Advanced Version Repository details","description":"This part of the tutorial will briefly outline where to find the major differences of the Advanced Version.
